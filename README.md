# Leap-Year

This is a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

It was used If Statements to code the Logic behind leap year calculation.

The code is in main.py file. The other files are just for IDE's console configuration.
